## Performance
Campfire2 and Crouton's performance are similar. The only reason to change from Crouton are Quality-of-Life improvements and maintenance. Basically, Campfire2 has the performance of Crouton but the reliability and GUI (known as Sommelier) of Crostini.

Crostini gets around ~17.5 FPS on default Minecraft using the (still very impressive!) VirGL drivers. On the other hand, using `i965` and Mesa gives ~25 fps. Chromebooks released in 2019 can utilize a newer kernel and the new Gallium3d drivers, which would probably offer around ~30 fps.

# Installing Campfire2
1. Install Chromebrew: `sudo rm -rf /usr/local > /dev/null; curl -Ls git.io/vddgY | bash`
2. Download/extract/configure the Ubuntu (20.04) Chroot:
```
crew install xterm xhost libunwind && echo "Downloading Ubuntu RootFS..." && curl --verbose -o /usr/local/ubuntu.tar.xz "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/minimal/releases/focal/release-20210625/ubuntu-20.04-minimal-cloudimg-amd64-root.tar.xz" && sudo rm -rf /usr/local/ubuntu; mkdir /usr/local/ubuntu && sudo tar -xvf /usr/local/ubuntu.tar.xz -C /usr/local/ubuntu && sudo rm /usr/local/ubuntu.tar.xz /usr/local/ubuntu/etc/resolv.conf && sudo mkdir /usr/local/ubuntu/root/Downloads && sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /usr/local/ubuntu/etc/resolv.conf && sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MilkyDeveloper/Campfire2/main/startubuntu -o /usr/local/bin/startubuntu && sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/startubuntu && startsommelier && echo "Done! Run sudo startubuntu to start the chroot."
```
Run `sudo startubuntu` to start the chroot.

## Extras
### 3d Acceleration
3d Acceleration under the chroot requires a few steps. This is because Google ships a kernel made in 2016 on some flagship chromebooks.
0. Install MESA: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install mesa-utils`
1. Verify 3d Acceleration is not working: `glxinfo -B | grep Device:` (If it returns `LLVMPipe`, 3d Acceleration is not working. Otherwise, 3d Acceleration is already working.)
2. Use i965 instead of Gallium3d/Iris: `echo -e "# Fix 3d Acceleration on Kernel 4.4\nexport MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=i965" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`

Run `glxinfo -b` again and search for LLVMPipe. It should be gone and replaced with `Mesa DRI Intel(R) UHD Graphics` ðŸŽ‰.

### Audio
1. <kbd><img height="15" width="75" src="https://assets.ubuntu.com/v1/048f7fde-ubuntu_black-orange_hex.jpg"></img></kbd> Install Pulseaudio and Apulse: `apt update && apt upgrade && apt install alsa alsa-tools apulse`
2. Run `speaker-test` (you may need to run it twice for it to work)

PulseAudio is complicated and is often considered bloated. A tool called Apulse is a much better alternative, creating a compatibility layer between PulseAudio libraries and ALSA. 99% of PulseAudio apps will work with Apulse. You can use Apulse by putting `apulse` before your command.
